# Huffman-Compression

Hello! Welcome to our Compression/Decompression Application
Developed by: Marwan Hossam and Ahmed ElSayed

Overview:
This application allows you to compress and decompress multiple(batch) files up to 4 GB in size

Instructions:

Compression:
When compressing a file, do not include a file extension in the output name (just add the output file name). The application will automatically add the .ece2103 extension to the compressed file.

Decompression:
When decompressing, make sure to include the appropriate file extension (e.g., .txt, .jpg, etc.) in the output filename.
If no extension is provided, the file will be decompressed with a generic .file extension instead of its original type.


To the run the GUI, enter the Form1.cs code and go to line 94 and add the file path to your exe file(make sure it ends with .exe)
